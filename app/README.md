# Codes for applications

This folder contains the codes of RingSketch and the related algorithms in four applications: RingCache, mining periodic Items, mining batches with variable thresholds, and estimating fresh Item Cardinality.

## File Structures

- `cache`: Performance testing of RingCache

- `batch`: Comparative experiments between RingSketch and other algorithms in terms of batch mining performance

- `cardinality`: Comparative experiments between RingSketch and other algorithms in terms of item cardinality estimation performance

- `periodic batch`: Comparative experiments between RingSketch and Periodic Sketch in terms of periodic element detection performance

More details on how to run the codes can be found in the folders
